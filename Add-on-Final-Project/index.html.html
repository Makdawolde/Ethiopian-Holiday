        Timket, also known as Ethiopian Epiphany, is one of the most vibrant and
        spiritually rich celebrations in Ethiopia, observed annually on January
        19th (or January 20th during leap years). It commemorates the baptism of
        Jesus Christ in the River Jordan and is deeply rooted in the traditions
        of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the Tabots arrive, they are respectfully placed in tents,
        symbolizing Christâ€™s journey to the River Jordan. The following morning,
        the main Timket ceremony begins at dawn with the blessing of the water.
        Priests perform rituals using ornate crosses dipped in the water, and
        worshippers either get sprinkled or fully immerse themselves as a
        symbolic act of spiritual renewal through baptism.
      </p>

      <p>
        To me, Timket has always been my favorite holidayâ€”not just for its rich
        spiritual significance and beautiful traditions, but because of the deep
        personal joy it brought me as a child. Growing up, it was the one time
        of year I was allowed to join my friends, cousins, and siblings outside
        on the streets, freely and joyfully celebrating with the entire
        neighborhood.
